# Buffer Overflow Exploits and Mitigation
Includes vulnerable C programs, x86 exploit opcode for the Netwide assembler.

### Docker Instructions

- Build the Docker image using the following command in the same directory where the Dockerfile is located:

```
docker build -t ubuntu_image .
```

- Once the image is built, you can run a container based on this image. This command will start a new container with the Ubuntu image containing Emacs and the specified options enabled. 

```
docker run -it ubuntu_image
```

---

### GNU Debugger
- Once gdb is installed, you should be able to use it to debug the core dump. For example:

```
gdb <executable_file> <core_dump_file>
```
---
### Dockerfile

- You need to have installed the gcc-multilib package in order to do 32 bit cross-compilation. The package is already included in the Ubuntu image.

- GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="find_preseed=/preseed.cfg auto noprompt priority=critical locale=en_US noexec=off noexec32=off"
### Segmentation Core dumps

- Run on the ubuntu terminal the following commands
```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="find_preseed=/preseed.cfg auto noprompt priority=critical locale=en_US noexec=off noexec32=off"
```
- Turn off randomize space:
```
echo "kernel.randomize_va_space=0" > /etc/sysctl.d/randomize_va_space.conf
```

- Enable core dumps
```
echo "kernel.core_pattern=core" > /etc/sysctl.d/core_pattern.conf
```

- Set ulimit to enable core dumps
```
ulimit -c unlimited
```

DO NOT RUN IN THIS STATE IN PRODUCTION
